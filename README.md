like. Some don't like that. 'There is about as many ways to code something as there are coders. You have
to find your own, sure, but then you'll get hired somewhere 'and they will absolutely hate everything that
you do that isn't done the way they like it. And they will be right. On a big project where 'several coders
works, at the same time and for month and years, you have to find a common ground or else the code
will become a nightmare 'to understand and maintain. Trust me: being able to adapt quickly to other's

code to illustrate // logical AND operator import java.io.*; class Logical { public static void main(String[]
args) { // initializing variables int a = 10, b = 20, c = 20, d = 0; // Displaying a, b, c System.out.println("Var1
= " + a); System.out.println("Var2 = " + b); System.out.println("Var3 = " + c); // using logical AND to verify
// two constraints if ((a c) && (++b > c)) { System.out.println("Inside if block"); } // displaying b
System.out.println("Value of b : " + b); } } Output: The output of AND Operator 2. Logical ‘OR’ Operator (||)
This operator returns true when one of the two conditions under consideration is satisfied or is true. If
even one of the two yields true, the operator results true. To make the result false, both the constraints
CUSTOMER COPY MIP-364-24-0100-000CUSTOMER COPYPage 30/58need to return false. Syntax: condition1 || condition2 Example: ADVERTISING a = 10, b = 20, c = 20
condition1: a c if(condition1 || condition2) d = a + b + c // Since one of the condition is true d = 50. // Java
code to illustrate // logical OR operator import java.io.*; class Logical { public static void main(String[]
args) { // initializing variables int a = 10, b = 1, c = 10, d = 30; // Displaying a, b, c System.out.println("Var1
= " + a); System.out.println("Var2 = " + b); System.out.println("Var3 = " + c); System.out.println("Var4 = "
+ d); // using logical OR to verify // two constraints if (a > b || c == d) System.out.println( "One or both +
the conditions are true"); else System.out.println( "Both the + conditions are false"); } } Output Var1 = 10
Var2 = 1 Var3 = 10 Var4 = 30 One or both + the conditions are true Now in the below example, we can see
the short-circuiting effect for OR operator. Here when the execution reaches to if statement, the first
condition inside the if statement is true and so the second condition is never checked. Thus the ++b (pre-
increment of b) never happens and b remains unchanged. Example import java.io.*; class
ShortCircuitingInOR { public static void main (String[] args) { // initializing variables int a = 10, b = 20, c =
15; // displaying b System.out.println("Value of b: " +b); // Using logical OR // Short-circuiting effect as the
first condition is true // so the second condition is never reached // and so ++b (pre-increment) doesn't
take place and // value of b remains unchanged if((a < c) || (++b < c)) System.out.println("Inside if"); //
displaying b System.out.println("Value of b: " +b); } } Output Value of b: 20 Inside if Value of b: 20 3.
Logical ‘NOT’ Operator (!) Unlike the previous two, this is a unary operator and returns true when the
condition under consideration is not satisfied or is a false condition. Basically, if the condition is false, the
operation returns true and when the condition is true, the operation returns false. Syntax: !(condition)
Example: a = 10, b = 20 !(ab) // returns true // Java code to illustrate // logical NOT operator import
java.io.*; class Logical { public static void main(String[] args) { // initializing variables int a = 10, b = 1; //
Displaying a, b, c System.out.println("Var1 = " + a); System.out.println("Var2 = " + b); // Using logical NOT
operator System.out.println("!(a < b) = " + !(a b) = " + !(a > b)); } } Output Var1 = 10 Var2 = 1 !(a b) = false
boolean a = true; boolean b = false; program – public class LogicalOperators { public static void
main(String[] args) { boolean a = true; boolean b = false; System.out.println("a: " + a);
System.out.println("b: " + b); System.out.println("a && b: " + (a && b)); System.out.println("a || b: " + (a ||
b)); System.out.println("!a: " + !a); System.out.println("!b: " + !b); } } Output a: true b: false a && b: false a
|| b: true !a: false !b: true Calculator in Java with Source Code Calculator in Java with Source Code: We

Calculate Electricity Bill Write a Java Program to Calculate Electricity Bill using Else If statement with
examples. Java Program to Calculate Electricity Bill using Else If This Java program asks the user to
enter the units consumed. Next, it calculates the Total Electricity bill. This approach is useful if the
Electricity board is charging different tariffs for different units. For this example, we are using the Else If
Statement. TIP: The Java Else If statement checks the first condition if it is TRUE, it executes the
statements inside that block. If the condition is FALSE, it checks the Next one (Else If condition) and so
on. import java.util.Scanner; public class ElectricityBill1 { private static Scanner sc; public static void

Amount = Units * 2.60; Sur_Charge = 25; } else if (Units <= 100) { // For the First Fifty Units Charge = 130
(50 * 2.60) // Next, we are removing those 50 units from total units Amount = 130 + ((Units - 50 ) * 3.25);
Sur_Charge = 35; } else if (Units <= 200) { // First Fifty Units charge = 130, and 50 - 100 is 162.50 (50 * 3.25)

the Printer Object Last Updated on Sat, 04 Feb 2023 | Upgrading Visual Basic In Visual Basic 6.0, the
Printer object enables applications to communicate with a system printer. The Printer object contains
functions for printing text, lines, and images. However, the printing model in the .NET Framework is quite
different from that in Visual Basic 6.0. The Printer object has become obsolete. Fortunately, the
functionality of the Printer object can be achieved with the classes that are provided in the
System.Drawing.Printing namespace, particularly the PrintDocument class. There are two main options
to upgrade the Visual Basic 6.0 printing functionality. The first option is to replace the Printer object
members with equivalent functionality provided by the PrintDocument class. Typically, this requires
reimplementation of the functionality; this will be demonstrated in the next code example. The second
option is to create your own Printer class in Visual Basic .NET based on the .NET PrintDocument class.
This approach will allow you to mask the .NET PrintDocument class functionality with the names
provided in the Visual Basic 6.0 Printer object. This second option will also be demonstrated later in this
section. Applying the first approach will require reimplementation of the printing code. The following
Visual Basic 6.0 code example prints four lines of text with different font settings: Private Sub
Form_Load() With Printer Printer.Print "Normal Line" .FontBold = True Printer.Print "Bold Line"
.FontItalic = True Printer.Print "Bold and Italic Line" .FontBold = False .FontItalic = False Printer.Print
"Second Normal Line" .EndDoc End With End Sub This code can be reimplemented in Visual Basic .NET
using methods of the PrintDocument class, as shown here. Dim WithEvents prn As New
Printing.PrintDocument Private Sub Form1_Load(ByVal eventSender As System.Object, _ ByVal
eventArgs As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load prn.Print() End Sub Private Sub
prn_PrintPage(ByVal sender As Object, _ ByVal e As System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs)
Handles prn.PrintPage Dim currFont As Font Dim yPos As Integer yPos = 1 With e.Graphics currFont =
New Font("Arial", 10, FontStyle.Regular) .DrawString("Normal Line", currFont, Brushes.Black, 1, yPos)
yPos = yPos + currFont.GetHeight currFont = New Font("Arial", 10, FontStyle.Bold) .DrawString("Bold
Line", currFont, Brushes.Black, 1, yPos) yPos = yPos + currFont.GetHeight currFont = New Font("Arial",
10, FontStyle.Bold Or FontStyle.Italic) .DrawString("Bold and Italic Line", currFont, Brushes.Black, 1,
yPos) yPos = yPos + currFont.GetHeight currFont = New Font("Arial", 10, FontStyle.Regular)
.DrawString("Second Normal Line", currFont, Brushes.Black, 1, yPos) End With End Sub Notice how the
structure of the code has changed and how the quantity of drawing methods has increased. The .NET
Framework provides more control and power over the drawing operations, but from the upgrade point of
view, it has a learning curve, and the manual reimplementation of all the printing functionality can
consume extensive resources. For more information about the equivalent functionality for the Printer
object members, see Tables 7.3 and 7.4 at the end of this section. For further guidance on printing from
Visual Basic .NET with the PrintDocument component, see "Printing with the PrintDocument
Component" in on MSDN. The second upgrade approach involves the creation of your own Printer class.
This allows you to consolidate several drawing methods and collections of graphical objects (such as
Circle or Line) and to store the coordinates that will be used to print these objects when the Print method
or the EndDoc method is called. When the Print method of the PrintDocument class is called, the
CUSTOMER COPY MIP-364-24-0100-000CUSTOMER COPYPage 37/58PrintPage event is raised. This event can be used to signal the application to draw all the objects and text
stored in the collections of your PrinterClass. The following Visual Basic .NET code provides a small
demonstration of how this Printer class can be developed. Imports Microsoft.VisualBasic.Compatibility '

methods and their Visual Basic .NET equivalents. Where there are no direct equivalents, links are
provided to additional information. The following example shows you how to convert Visual Basic 6.0
code that uses a printer object to Visual Basic .NET code that uses your own printer class as mentioned
earlier. Printer.FillColor = vbBlue Printer.FillStyle = vbSolid Printer.Circle (3000, 3000), 1500, vbRed
Printer.EndDoc The preceding Visual Basic 6.0 code will print a circle filled with blue color and it will
have a red border. To convert this code to Visual Basic .NET, you can use the printer class mentioned
earlier and perform the following steps. First, you have to add this printer class to the .NET project. After
this, you have to add a reference to the Micosoft.VisualBasic.Compatibility assembly. The next step is to
create a Visual Basic .NET module and add the following code. Module Module1 Public Printer As
PrinterClass = New PrinterClass End Module Finally, you need to perform some small changes to the
original Visual Basic 6.0 code to make it consistent with the new definition of your own printer class.
Here is the resulting Visual Basic .NET code. Printer.FillColor = Color.Blue Printer.FillStyle =
PrinterClass.FillStyleConstants.vbFSSolid Printer.Circle(New Point(3000, 3000), 1500, Color.Red)

the Printers Collection Visual Basic 6.0 provides the Printers collection, which is used to return
information about available printers on a system. For example, it is possible to determine the printer
layout for a particular printer. Visual Basic .NET does not support the Printers collection. The printing
CUSTOMER COPY MIP-364-24-0100-000CUSTOMER COPYPage 39/58model has changed, and as a result, references to the Printers collection require manual adjustment
when upgrading to Visual Basic .NET. Consider the following Visual Basic 6.0 example, which uses the
Printers collection to find the first available printer with its page orientation set to Portrait. If such a
printer is found in the collection, a message box showing the printer device name is displayed. The code
for the example follows. Dim prn As Printer For Each prn In Printers If prn.Orientation = vbPRORPortrait
Then MsgBox prn.DeviceName ' Stop looking for a printer. Exit For End If Next Because the Printers
collection is not supported in Visual Basic .NET, this code cannot be automatically upgraded with the
upgrade wizard. Applying the upgrade wizard results in the code being marked with upgrade issues, such
as the one demonstrated here. ' UPGRADE_ISSUE: Printers collection was not upgraded. For Each prn In
Printers The only way to achieve a similar effect in Visual Basic .NET is to implement your own Printers
collection, using various classes the Microsoft .NET Framework provides. For example, you can create a
new Visual Basic .NET module and class like the following. Module PrintersModule Public Printers As
New PrintersCollection End Module Public Class PrintersCollection : Implements IEnumerable Private
printer As System.Drawing.Printing.PrinterSettings Public ReadOnly Property Count() As Integer Get
Return System.Drawing.Printing.PrinterSettings.InstalledPrinters.Count End Get End Property Public
ReadOnly Property Item(ByVal Index As Integer) _ As System.Drawing.Printing.PrinterSettings Get
printer = New System.Drawing.Printing.PrinterSettings printer.PrinterName = _
System.Drawing.Printing.PrinterSettings.InstalledPrinters.Item(Index) Return printer End Get End
Property Overridable Function GetEnumerator() As IEnumerator _ Implements
IEnumerable.GetEnumerator Dim Count As Integer = _
System.Drawing.Printing.PrinterSettings.InstalledPrinters.Count Dim printersArray(Count) As
System.Drawing.Printing.PrinterSettings Dim i As Integer For i = 0 To Count - 1 printersArray(i) = New
System.Drawing.Printing.PrinterSettings printersArray(i).PrinterName = _
System.Drawing.Printing.PrinterSettings.InstalledPrinters.Item(i) Next Return
printersArray.GetEnumerator() End Function End Class After the preceding module and class are created
and added to the upgrade solution, the original code can be upgraded with only a few minor tweaks.
These are shown here (changes are highlighted in bold). Dim prn As
System.Drawing.Printing.PrinterSettings For Each prn In Printers If prn.DefaultPageSettings.Landscape
= False Then MsgBox(prn.PrinterName) Exit For End If Next For more information about replacing the
Printers collection functionality in Visual Basic .NET, see "Printers Collection Changes in Visual Basic
.NET" in Visual Basic Concepts on MSDN. Continue reading here: Upgrading the Clipboard Object •
ownload source code - 62.8 KB Introduction In this article, I will explain how to communicate with PLC
(Programmable Logic Controller). I started my PLC communication program using .NET from 2007. For a
basic understanding of what PLC is, use Google because basically I am not a PLC Engineer or Electrical
Engineer. However, I will explain to you how to connect PLC using .NET programs, how to read data from
PLC, and how to write data to PLC. My sample programs are all based on MELSEC PLC using TCP/IP
communication. There are different kinds of PLC available like MELSEC ,SIMENS, etc. For each PLC
communication, there are different types of protocols available. In this demo program, I have used TCP
IP communication for MELSEC PLC. Here, I have mentioned .NET programs instead of a language in
.NET. In my article, you will find four zip files: SPLCSharpConnect.zip contains the PLC component DLL
source code. I started PLC communication programming in 2007. At that time, I was coding using
VB.NET. I created my own Winsock component using VB.NET. Even now for PLC communication, I am
using the same Winsock component MelsecPLC.dll in my projects. In that component, I have created
simple functions as Connect, Disconnect, Read, Write and a DataArrival event. In the sample project
attached, I have used the same DLL. Before we start PLC communication programming, I'd like to explain
the read and write processes in PLC communication. Read Data from PLC PLC Read Command: To read
data from PLC, we need to send the command to PLC. Basically, the command we send will be like this:
"500000FF03FF000018000A04010000D*0095000001"; C# String cmd = ""; cmd = cmd + "5000" ; // sub
HEAD (NOT) cmd = cmd + "00" ; // network number (NOT) cmd = cmd + "FF" ; //PLC NUMBER cmd = cmd
+ "03FF" ; // DEMAND OBJECT MUDULE I/O NUMBER cmd = cmd + "00" ; // DEMAND OBJECT MUDULE
DEVICE NUMBER cmd = cmd + "001C" ; // Length of demand data cmd = cmd + "000A"; // CPU inspector
data cmd = cmd + "0401"; // Read command (to read the data from PLC we should "0401" cmd = cmd +
"0000" ; // Sub command cmd = cmd +"D*" ; // device code cmd = cmd + "009500"; //adBase cmd = cmd +
"0001"; //Device No ,It’s a Address every PLC device will have an address //we need to send the
appropriate address to read the data. Write Data to PLC PLC Write Command: To write data to PLC, we
need to send the command to PLC. Basically, the command we send will be like this:
"500000FF03FF00001C000A14010000D*0095010002". C# String cmd = ""; cmd = cmd + "5000"; // sub
CUSTOMER COPY MIP-364-24-0100-000CUSTOMER COPYPage 40/58HEAD (NOT) cmd = cmd + "00"; // network number (NOT) cmd = cmd + "FF"; // PLC NUMBER cmd = cmd
+ "03FF"; // DEMAND OBJECT MUDULE I/O NUMBER cmd = cmd + "00"; // DEMAND OBJECT MUDULE
DEVICE NUMBER cmd = cmd + "001C"; // Length of demand data cmd = cmd + "000A"; // CPU inspector
data cmd = cmd + "1401"; // Write command cmd = cmd + "0000"; // Sub command cmd = cmd + "D*"; //
device code cmd = cmd + "009501"; // adBase cmd = cmd + "0002"; // BASE ADDRESS You can see the
difference, to read we use "0401" and "009500" but for write we use "1401" and "009501". The detailed
code will be listed below. Using the Code I have attached C# sample programs for PLC communication in
this article but for explanation here, I have used my component MelsecPLC.dll in the test project. First,
add MelsecPLC.dll to your project. 1. Declare MelsecPLC.dll in the Form C# // using MelsecPLC; 2.
Variable Declarations C# // public MelsecPLC.Winsock winsock1; // Declare the MelsecPLC Winsock
Component string Jig01; // To store the PLC read data. 3. Connect (PLC Connection) For connection, we
need the PLC IP address. Here, my PLC IP address is “10.126.224.221”. Enter the local port and remote
port. Here, I have used “1027” for the local port and “8000” for the remote port. In form load, we call the
PLC Connect function and we create a MelsecPLC DataArrival event. The DataArrival event will be
triggered when PLC sends data to the PC (our computer). The detailed connect functions and DataArrival
declaration in the form load are listed below: C# Shrink ▲ // private void Form1_Load(object sender,
EventArgs e) { winsock1Connect(); winsock1.DataArrival += new
MelsecPLC.Winsock.DataArrivalEventHandler(winsock1_DataArrival); timer1.Enabled = true;
timer1.Start(); } private void winsock1Connect() { try { if (winsock1.GetState.ToString() != "Connected") {
winsock1.LocalPort = 1027; winsock1.RemoteIP ="10.126.224.221"; int a = 8000; winsock1.RemotePort =
8000; winsock1.Connect(); } } catch (Exception ex) { } } 4. DataArrival Event In the DataArrival event, we
get the actual data sent by PLC after the Read signal is sent to PLC. This event will be triggered whenever
PLC sends data to the PC. To get data from PLC, we use the winsock1.GetData() method. C# // private
void winsock1_DataArrival(MelsecPLC.Winsock sender, int BytesTotal) { String s = String.Empty;
winsock1.GetData(ref s); Jig01 = s; } 5. Read Data from PLC To read data from PLC, we need to send the
signal to PLC for data read. I have explained the read functions in my article introduction. To send read
signal to PLC, we use the winsock1.Send() method. C# Shrink ▲ // private void btnRead_Click(object
sender, EventArgs e) { if (winsock1.GetState.ToString() != "Connected") { winsock1Connect(); } //String
cmd = "500000FF03FF000018000A04010000D*0095000001"; String cmd = ""; String OutAddress = "0001";
cmd = ""; cmd = cmd + "5000" ; // sub HEAD (NOT) cmd = cmd + "00" ; // network number (NOT) cmd =
cmd + "FF" ; // PLC NUMBER cmd = cmd + "03FF" ; // DEMAND OBJECT MUDULE I/O NUMBER cmd =
cmd + "00" ; // DEMAND OBJECT MUDULE DEVICE NUMBER cmd = cmd + "001C" ; // Length of demand
data cmd = cmd + "000A"; // CPU inspector data cmd = cmd + "0401"; // Read command cmd = cmd +
"0000" ; // Sub command cmd = cmd +"D*" ; // device code cmd = cmd + "009500"; // adBase cmd = cmd
+ OutAddress; // BASE ADDRESS winsock1.Send(cmd); } 6. Write Data to PLC To write data to PLC, we
need to send the signal to PLC for data write. I have explained the write functions in my article
introduction. To send a write signal to PLC, here we use the winsock1.Send() method. C# Shrink ▲ //
private void btnWrite_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { if (winsock1.GetState.ToString() !=
"Connected") { winsock1Connect(); } String cmd = ""; String OutAddress = txtWrite.Text.Trim(); cmd = "";
cmd = cmd + "5000"; // sub HEAD (NOT) cmd = cmd + "00"; // network number (NOT) cmd = cmd + "FF";
// PLC NUMBER cmd = cmd + "03FF"; // DEMAND OBJECT MUDULE I/O NUMBER cmd = cmd + "00"; //
DEMAND OBJECT MUDULE DEVICE NUMBER cmd = cmd + "001C"; // Length of demand data cmd =
cmd + "000A"; // CPU inspector data cmd = cmd + "1401"; // Write command cmd = cmd + "0000"; // Sub
command cmd = cmd + "D*"; // device code cmd = cmd + "009501"; // adBase cmd = cmd + OutAddress;
// BASE ADDRESS winsock1.Send(cmd); } Macro project visual basic run Sub frx() ' ' frx Macro ' ' End
